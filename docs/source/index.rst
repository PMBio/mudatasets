mudatasets are here
===================

``MuData`` is a format for annotated multimodal datasets, and ``mudatasets`` is a library that allows to fetch some publicly available datasets as ``MuData`` objects. It mainly focuses on omics datasets such as multiome (ATAC+RNA) and CITE-seq (PROT+RNA).

Please refer to the `mudata documentation <https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for the details on the format and to `the muon documentation <https://muon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for the usage examples.
